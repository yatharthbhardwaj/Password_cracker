This Python script is designed to crack passwords using a brute-force approach by generating all possible combinations of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and the special characters up to a specified maximum length and checking each combination against the given password. To use the script, simply run it and enter the password you want to crack when prompted. The script utilizes multiprocessing to split the task across multiple CPU cores, significantly speeding up the process. It reports the time taken and the total number of combinations tried once the password is cracked. The default character set includes uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and the special characters and the maximum password length is set to 15 characters, but these can be adjusted as needed. This tool is intended for educational purposes and should only be used ethically and legally.
